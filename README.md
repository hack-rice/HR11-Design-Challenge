# HR11-Design-Challenge

## Challenge Description
When writing any new software, especially during the early stages, developers sometimes lose sight of the user experience (UX) in the pursuit of optimizing for functionality. While a functional product is always necessary, its value is undermined without good UX. UX looks to solve user pain points and fulfill the user's needs. This challenge focuses on UX.

## Prompt
Given limited time during this hackathon, we challenge you to make your product appealing to users by striking a balance between functionality and design. Judges will evaluate your UX based on usability, clarity, accessibility, and appearance. Make sure every design decision is deliberate! In addition to your final product, you are also encouraged to submit your design thinking process.
